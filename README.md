# CrevoResources

This repository contains a variety of resources for team use throughout the season, though its primary use case will be prototyping. Current entries include:

* Games:
  * A list of frc games and their notable aspects (2009-present). Use this to find out which years will have similar mechanisms to the one you are researching.
* Research Resources
  * Some robots/designs that I have found noteworthy. This should be one of the first places you look well researching.
* Drivetrains
  * A quick list of common FRC drivetrain. When I have time, this will be replaced by an in depth PowerPoint.

Remember, one of the vital keys to success is knowing your mechanism inside and out. Don't just build something because its a cool idea in your head. More than likely, someone has already built a mechanism and learned a lot of the hard lessons for you. Build on their knowledge, don't start from scratch.
