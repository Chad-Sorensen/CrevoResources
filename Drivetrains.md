# Drivetrains

**Tank/West Coast**  
This simplest of the major drivetrains, tank drive usually consists of 4-8 wheels which are located on either side of the robot. The drivetrain turns 
by driving the left side in one direction and the right side in the other. The drivetrain pivots on its center axis (if all wheels are driven). It has high pushing power at the cost of less manuverability.

**H-Drive**  
This drivetrain is essentially a tank drive with an omni-wheel in the middle, perpendicular to the rest of the wheels (it should be noted that all wheels are omni). This center wheel is used to allow the robot to strafe. Due to the drivetrain consisting of all omni wheels, it has no pushing power.

**Butterfly Drive**  
A general term for any drivetrain that switches between two different modes. A common configuration is tank and H.

**Swerve Drive**  
A drivetrain consisting of 3 to 4 wheel hubs which can rotate 360 degrees allowing for high manuverabilty and pushing power. Easily the most complex of the common frc drivetrains. If the rotation of the wheels is linked together it is refered to as crab drive. It also comes in 2 variants, coaxial and non-coaxial.

**Boat Drive**  
Well untested in the frc environment, this drive train consists of a propeler and a rudder which will propel and manuver the robot through the water. Even though no game so far has required this drive train, we will be ready when one does.
